# @virgo/ui

Lightweight component primitives shared across Virgo applications. Components render semantic HTML and rely on the host application's global styles.

## Components

- `Button` — applies Virgo button styling and supports `variant="ghost"` or `fullWidth` props.
- `Card` — structural wrapper that standardizes paddings, rounded corners, and background usage.

Import from the package root:

```ts
import { Button, Card } from "@virgo/ui";
```
